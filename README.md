# SkillSkin – AI-assisted Muscle Memory Training

## Overview
SkillSkin is an AI-assisted healthcare prototype designed to improve muscle memory training and rehabilitation. The project explores how artificial intelligence and wearable feedback systems can help users perform correct physical movements during therapy and skill training.

## Problem Statement
In physiotherapy and rehabilitation, patients often perform exercises incorrectly due to lack of real-time guidance. This slows recovery and increases the risk of injury.

## Proposed Solution
SkillSkin proposes a smart wearable patch that:
- Monitors muscle movement signals
- Uses AI logic to analyze movement patterns
- Provides real-time corrective feedback via vibration or micro-impulses

## AI Workflow (Conceptual)
1. Movement / muscle activity data collection  
2. AI-based pattern recognition  
3. Detection of incorrect or inefficient movements  
4. Real-time feedback to guide correct motion
